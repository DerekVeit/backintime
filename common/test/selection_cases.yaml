# Each top-level key names a test case for test_rsync_selections.py

# Normal properties:
#   includes: paths to be configured as included in the backup
#   excludes: paths to be configured as excluded in the backup
#   files_tree: the files to be made available for the backup (see filetree.py)
#   expected_tree: the files that should be copied for the backup

# Properties for cases expecting an exception to be raised:
#   exception_type_name
#   expected_message

# A property to mark special cases:
#   flags:
#       "original_fails": The case fails for the "original" strategy.
#       "sorted_only": The case is only applicable for the "sorted" strategy.
#       "fs_root": The case needs to use / as an included path.
